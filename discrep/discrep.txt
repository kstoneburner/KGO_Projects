B3  TITLE 42 REACTION  Had to drop Tara's live intro, tag and Q&amp;A from East 37 camera. The camera was
out of synch through the board. The director was not able to determine that until the commercial break before Tara's hit. There was no prior notice the camera was not functional. Engineering is aware and is working on it.




G8 SOUTHWEST REFUND  Finney's tease, intro, toss and vo script were all in the same rundown line and prompter got lost. Also, Finney's copy did not match the video he was refferencing.
