A2 PRESHOW - We heard audio from a pop-up ad that was on our website on the first clip. The director tried to stop it and that led the system to advance past the COLDOPEN just as the video began to air. So we dumped out of the COLDOPEN early. Director says a button got stuck which was the source of the extraneous audio. 


6PM
At some point during the newscast, we lost captioning. DC3 said they began providing captioning.

Narrative




B2 BIDEN PELOSI: Live camera was not ready for live shot. We went to VO instead.




B8 TREATMENT BEDS: Incorrect version of BABBA chip used in baseline.




D6 STUDENT LOANS: Typo in baseline. Fixed for future use.




D15 TAKE ACTION: Sat in black during entire script. Graphic was promocard but coded as FS. For all PRODUCERS: Please put PROMOCARD only in segment column. Then write PROMOCARD again in graphics column. This will help flag director that it's not a regular FS.




F4 TESLA PIE ORDER: Flashframe in package. Fixed for later.

"Re: 5&6PM Discrepancy Report","Hi all,

The work was being done on Graphite 4, G3 is on Xpression 1.  Two different devices. 

Graphites are no longer used for news show animations with the new graphics packages. 

Kurt has an established fix for the issue shown today, the directors have a button to enact the fix. 

Thanks!

We are getting a lot more ghost floats recently – within the last week – so please be cognizant of it. I'm assuming it's something connected to the new graphics... but I don't know what is causing it.

A19 - code for the map ghostfloated – so we were one step behind on cgs before we could catch up

F18 - F25 - location in boxes did not show up when we took the boxes... 
however – the location randomly popped up in the middle of drews' weather (in the middle of the screen over his gfx). The location wasn't in any graphics channel so we couldn't clear it. Picture attached.

Go Niners!

First off – I was unable to create a rundown at all this morning. I tried several times - and even tried changing the start time – and still nothing. Dalet kept giving me an error message. Had to duplicate the entire rundown from Tuesday and delete everything out of it.

A30 - promocard went to black, couldn't recreate it during break

e27 - Rundown got out of order for director. Everything was numbered correctly in my rundown – but his overdrive was all out of order. Had to manually click each element coming up since the rundown wasn't working. Eventually got back on track at end of E block and through rest of the show.

Buckle up.
-Top of show cameras did not move - director investigating.
-Breaks had trouble rolling, A36 break showed fault on timeline despite it being same as previous break. Possible old coding. Lots of trouble w/ the digital breaks and bumpbacks
-Cut-ins were all messed up. Clipped mics, open mics, break between 727 cut-in didn't have fade to black 
-7 things digicart too loud - it has been lowered
-Lots of bumpbacks went to black instead of a live shot 
-Some CGs had missing chips those have been fixed
-Gloria's hit had some CG issues with order of operations

Thanks to everyone for helping with the breaking news coverage on the avalanche!




There was some miscommunication between our side & DC3 about what the plan was for staying in continuing coverage. This led to them cutting us off when we had intended to stay on air. Also, there was some confusion with the stream, which stayed on the Oakland officer's funeral.




That eventually got ironed out & we stayed on linear until approximately 12:20ish.

First traffic hit - coding for Gloria's traffic graphics had audio changed in the pattern, unbeknownst to Director. Has since been recoded correctly throughout the remainder of the 6a newscast and in the pattern.





Monitor behind anchors not working to route live picture as the switch was not functioning, being investigated by engineering.





Double swipe on BAM during a live desk, Recovered and moved on through live desk script.

First traffic hit - coding for Gloria's traffic graphics had audio changed in the pattern, unbeknownst to Director. Has since been recoded correctly throughout the remainder of the 6a newscast and in the pattern.




Monitor behind anchors not working to route live picture as the switch was not functioning, being investigated by engineering.




Double swipe on BAM during a live desk, Recovered and moved on through live desk script.

A18 FIRST WEATHER - jumped out of Sandhya's hit a little early, mispunch.

Sports mic died within the first story. Thanks to Dan for handing his mic over to Chris for the remainder of the sportscast, and thanks to Chris for the on-air explanation for our viewers!



Great work by everyone today – especially everyone out in the field covering the Oakland shooting and the rain. I appreciate you all!

Happy New Year!

D2 TOSS STEPHANIE - moved around the elements of this intro so I could update a breaker right before. Unfortunately, there wasn't enough time for the SOTVO to load, so we saw the anchors, a stinger, and then the anchors again. They kept reading and tossed to Stephanie.

Break 1 did not roll. Apparently it's because I did tease 1 all on camera, and filed a tease bump cg there. I have just learned from Kurt that in the case of a tease being all on camera, the cg filed needs to be a baseline and not a tease bump. Now I know!

A3 COLD OPEN SOTVO - anchors slow to begin reading because they couldn't hear. For some reason routing was incorrect. Repeated the routing and that seemed to fix it.

A4 HELLO 2OC - camera routed in monitor behind anchors was showing grey. Switched to new camera in first package.

A13 TSUNAMI EVACUATIONS INT - we didn't know Luz's live shot had such a long delay, so there was an awkward pause for the toss. Chris cued her early for the tag and it was less awkward.

D10 SC DEATH PENALTY PKG - missed slot due to late court hearing. We opted to float the pkg and run a VO instead. The PKG will run at 1030pm.

B12 LAND BACK PKG - banner CGs would not load. The name CGs were fine, but banner CGs could not be called up. Unknown reason why. They previewed just fine. Tried several fixes in the break after it aired and we were unable to fix the banner CGs.

C11 CA INSURANCE SOTVO - Dan's mic didn't open after the SOT part of the tease. Unknown reason why. Tested it in the break after and everything was fine.

Prompter was in the wrong spot at the top of the show and appeared to be confused where to start. As we dealt with trying to fix that that issue, director ended up going to the A11 SOT very early and clipped Dion.

A28: two names mispronounced in the packaged. Fixed.

A11 HELLO - instead of seeing boxes off the top we saw the WXC camera shot. Extra code was left in the hello line which jumped the system ahead. We weren't able to run through the hello before the show bc our attempted runthru was visible on the streaming show for an unknown reason.

F8 TEASE SPORTS - Sports Mic and IFB did not work. Larry switched to Guest 1 Mic during the break. Engineering is looking at the mic now.

	A22 SMC SHERIFF missed slot causing a ripple effect of problems. Had to juggle block by block until it got in. Monica's mic got clipped because she and Dan were originally on the same mic and had to switch once I moved Dan down.

For the cold open, a graphic got stuck in a channel, which is why the cold open video & banner looked cut off. Kurt has fixed it.

A20.1 US HOUSE DISTRICT 12 FS - the heads on this election graphic weren't displaying on air, even though they previewed fine. This is a known error. Thanks to Brandon for quickly rebuilding this manually. It didn't have the checkbox but it did have faces and the latest numbers.

A31 CA PROPS OVERVIEW S prop 32 - this graphic had to be manually built in order to have the latest numbers and the yes and no votes were accidentally flipped. Fixed.

B5 TOSS PHIL FS2 - Chris was running through this segment in the break and saw that it looked really ugly going from the 1st to 2nd fullscreen AND the 3rd fullscreen wouldn't reveal (there are 3 total). Quickly tried to turn the 2nd and 3rd FS into VO, but they didn't brio in time and it showed black on air. Came out on cam.

A rollercoaster of shows...

In the 5: 
OAKLAND CRIME PKG had issues. Director's timeline was not updating. Engineering had to mos off & on to get everything updated.
Pkg eventually played buts CGs could not be pulled up. 
POSTAL CRASH PKG was not loading correctly in Director's timeline.   
Incorrect version with Steph's on-cam intro played even though the placeholder, cutsheet & everything else was correct on our end. 

      
In the 6:
Same thing happened the next hour. Engineering had to mos off & on to update timeline, but pkgs still wouldn't play. 
OAKLAND CRIME PKG had to move down to a funky spot while director & engineering fixed it. Once it was able to play, we took it but GFX could not be pulled up. 
POSTAL CRASH PKG had to be killed because it would not play at all in the 6. Timeline wouldn't recognize the pkg. 
So, I added a dayside pkg last minute to make up for the time. Sports pushed down.

During the interview around 11:40, we tried to cut cameras and everything went to black. All items went away (camera, cgs, bug, INTD gfx) except for microphones. Both the director and engineering are investigating. 

Break 5 did not roll right away, DC3 spoke up and we rolled the break again and it worked.

Anchor 2 button on the right PL panel in PC3 got stuck multiple times. It also didn't work several times when I tried to talk to Kristen so I would have to relay things through Karina or Chris would have to talk to her. Extremely frustrating during breaking news. When I switched to the left PL panel and I was able to communicate with everyone and things went much smoother. Overall things looked great. We got on the air a little after 2PM and did not take a break. 3PM and World News did not air due to our continuing coverage.

Brief internet outage before the newscast cause a lot of problems.

It affected Vinten, DNF, overdrive, prompter and more ??? 

Dave Fortin was in the control booth throughout the show fixing issues as the came up.




A few included:

Prompter wouldn't update. Took a bit to fix that. Ipads were updating.
A block 3M tease: 3M graphic didn't come up
Locator from Prop 4 package showed up in Pentagon story. There's no reason that should have happened.
B-block main weather intro Spencer shot was deleted. Spencer quickly walked over to the key and we got back on track.

We found that having multiple quote gfx back-to-back with reveals will not operate properly. In order to remedy this issue, writers/producers will have to break up quote text into *separate Xpression items. 

To our knowledge, you can still use a single quote gfx with multiple pages as long as it stands alone.


Hope this helps,
Thank you,

Narrative

Couple of issues coming in and out of boxes with weather. Had a delay going into the main weather... Mics cutout in the toss back from the mini weather hit. Tested in the break and there were no problems.

Tease banner didn't playout for B20.

Need to update the Where You Are promo, it still has Kumasi and Ryan Curry in it.

Sky7 went to black at the top of the show while we were still on it for the cold open.

Producer error on the A's history 3M. This script got deleted and when I put it back in the show, I mis-noted ""no reveals"" on the graphics notes column, when the script called for reveals. So we saw the 3M on tv, but it didn't match the script as closely as I intended.


THANK YOU to the sports department for handling my many requests today.

And extra shoutout THANK YOU  to Juan Carlos for putting together an A's nat pkg today! Very nicely done! 🙂

"Re: 7am show report 9/9: Countdown Bug","Action: 

*	
	Producers, please do not file the countdown bug to a rundown. 
*	
	The director will recall the countdown bug using Overdrive.


Issue:

*	
	The countdown bug has been assigned a Fixed ID which Overdrive uses to recall the graphic.
*	
	When a Fixed ID graphic is deleted, floated, or MOS Deactivated all graphics with that Fixed ID are removed from the system.
*	
	There should be only one instance of Fixed ID graphic at a time.
*	
	Fixed ID CGs are filed to the Saturday, Dalet OD XPression rundown. 


Sample Graphics with Fixed IDs.

A46 OAKLAND PRIDE PARADE FS - outline of facebook and instagram logos showed up over this promocard. They aren't there in preview. We've used this graphic before with no problems. Unknown reason why. (FYI the Twitter Facebook Instagram line in the graphic build doesn't show up with these outlines)
Same outline of facebook and instagram logos showed up over the Contact 7OYS promocard (in line B6), but they didn't overlap anything on that graphic so it didn't look too bad.

C7 LABOR DAY TRAVEL REM - wrong boxes coded, saw Dan on cam and then towercam full.

D2 SENIOR SCAM MOC-FS - the graphic from line D12 was stuck in Channel G3, and we saw a faint overlay of that graphic (the voice/vote countdown) over the 7 On Your Side Investigates 3M graphic as well as the 2shot. Chris cleared all channels and it went away.

D12 CAMPAIGN LABOR DAY MOC-FS - didn't display. Probably related to prior issue when its channel got stuck. Upon closer review realized this graphic (COUNTDOWN 3M, FOUND IN PERSISTENT>ELECTION FOLDER) is listed as a 3M but was created as a FS in G3. Do NOT use until fixed!

The cold open was of a kind that I had yet to attempt. There were issues with it that I did not have time to solve in the seven or so minutes leading up to the show. I now know what prevented it from working and will share that with my fellow directors in tomorrow morning’s Zoom call.

A few problems off the top - kudos to Chris for running through the show as soon as he got control in PC3 and identifying issues which we tried to fix.

 

A10 COLD OPEN - Planned for a 3M monitor on cam with a lower third, but the 3M graphic didn't display. Tried changing the lower third from cold open to regular banner but that didn't resolve the issue. Tried turning the 3M MOC-FS into a VO clip (the aircheck was already ingesting and I edited in the booth). Recoded in a hurry and didn't get to run through it. Realized at the end of the preshow that the cold open still wasn't going to air correctly so we came out to the 2shot instead.

 

Because we spent several minutes troubleshooting the cold open, we were unable to run through the show and prevent the following issues:

 

A16 LIBERTY MUTUAL INT - graphic didn't display in the TRAFR monitor. Fixed for the tag.

 

A23 WHITE HOUSE HOUSING INT - video was not seen in the BAM because it hadn't been routed back to normal. BAM had been left on a powerpoint presentation. This was for an INTD SPLIT reporter shot. Zoomed into just the INTL for the tag.

 

 

Also, several times the anchors commented that their iPads were not updating scripts.

Brio challenges tonight.

Same issue, same result:
A5 preshow3 
A9 COLD OPEN sotvo
Because of the Brio challenge, we dumped these clips and re-fired to the X side, but clips did not cue when we prepped them on the timeline. Resulted in empty wipe to black with CG over. Came out to camera for the Hello. 

Also - main aircheck and backup aircheck both failed to record. In lieu of 11pm repeat on the stream, DC3 is going to air World News Now for the contigency

Overdrive issues at the top of the newscast. Overdrive client lost connection to the switcher twice, but recovered. During break switched over to backup Overdrive server and no more problems during the newscast.

*         Anchors  had to stretch in the hello while we waited for the switcher.

*         Took a bit to get to Luz

 

 

A9 SF RV PARKING PKG: Only saw banner cg for package. Fed in late and media managers had to tweak things. Barely made air, but cut sheet was unable to be completed. With the other issues we just made the call to not chance guessing at the cgs.

 

D8 TEEN VOTE PKG: Wrong pronouncer for Berkeley’s mayor. Fixing for later shows.

All good except the D block...

D6.2 HARRIS ON TRUMP SOT - was listed in rundown as SOT but scripted and edited as SOTVO. As a result, Chris jumped ahead to D7 when the SOT ended.
D7 HARRIS UAW ENDORSEMENT VO - saw the FS for D8 over this story, and the FS was blank. Took a while to get the correct video on air.
D8 PEW ELECTION INTEREST FS - the graphic showed up blank. We eventually came on cam to Dan. Then accidentally rerolled D7 before getting back on track with D9. The reveals on this graphic were a late add and they didn't work. Nothing revealed. Unknown reason why.  It previews fine. We tested the graphic in a later block and it still wouldn't show up, with or without reveals it was all blank.

D10: Full screen did not show content upon bringing up the graphic, learned that the 'reveal' object/field also has a blank setting that can be turned on. That will in turn not bring up any content. Good note for anyone who builds these in the future to always check that setting. Especially if you reset the graphic by selecting ""revert all fields to template values."" 

TLDR: producer error

D17 SEN BOB MENENDEZ FS - reveal didn't work so we didn't see the second page of the graphic. Graphic had been built correctly but at some point was changed from two pages to one page. Likely producer error: when I was clicking preview from page 2 to page 1, I probably changed the number of pages from 2 pages to 1 page (the lines are right next to each other in xpression)

Kudos to Chris & Larry & media managers for putting together today's sports segment!

Due to a catastrophic systemwide computer failure there was no newscast. We ended up taking KABC which also was experiencing a severe outage. Computers started failing throughout the newsroom at around 10PM.

Lots of Dalet issues today – slowdowns, crashes, reboots, disconnects, reconnects, missing scripts, half updated lines...

A22 TRUMP RALLY DAVID DUTCH FS - problem with this graphic. Jen noticed it on runthrough that it wouldn't load after a VO1/2FS, so we moved it down a line so that there was a VO in between and we thought that would solve it. However, it caused an issue with  channel G3 and that problem was visible in the first element of the preshow. Jen cleared it by the second line of the preshow. When we actually got to A22, the graphic did not air correctly. It previewed no problem. Unknown reason for this issue.

Thank you to Ed Walsh for catching the Kate Steinle mention by Ted Cruz & to Heather and Media Managers for quickly turning around a bite for 630!

"RE: 5PM Discrepancy Report","After the 5p show, engineering troubleshot the Dalet issue.  While troubleshooting the issue, we were able to determine that the Dalet MOS Services were in a bad state.  Shows were MOS’d off and the Dalet MOS Services were restarted.  Once the Dalet MOS Services were running, the shows were MOS’d on again in Dalet to bring the Control Rooms functioning at 5:50p.

Dalet system failure led to many changes on the fly. Producer floated a late package about three minutes before it was slated to air. The change did not take in prompter, and director's Dalet did not reflect the change. I had anchors toss to break. 

 

Producer lost all control of Dalet at 5:14 and lost the ability to time the show or make any rundown changes. 

 

Anchors and director did a good job adjusting to the changes and executing the rest of the newscast without control of Dalet.

 

Engineering worked to correct the issue which appears to have been resolved for the 6PM.

A graphics channel got stuck in the package in page G4, leading to a little yellow box appearing on the upper left of the screen. The director cleared the channel out to remove the yellow box, resulting in a random FS to pop up for a split second.

G4 was re-tested during the break and the issue did not re-occur.

A7 SCC HEAT DEATHS: Package rolled too quickly. Director's Dalet crashed and he was trying to get back in while directing - causing the issue.

*	
	Dalet today had a lot of issues. Both Chris and I had Dalet lock up - which lasted for several minutes. We both killed Dalet in order to get back.

B18 TEASE 2: We saw the fullscreen from the guest interview instead of the VO. Tease was coded properly. Director ran through again during break and everything ran fine. Not sure what caused the problem.

"Re: 9am show report 7/7","Report from DC3, boils down to wrong control room on the schedule for the tease.

Incident Details: 
:43 of black on air during term break of This Week. News Tease was scheduled on PCR3 at 08:58:57 instead of PCR2. Delay caused the 9am news to start :28 later than scheduled. 

Note: Operator reached out to station to tell them they were hot and rolled term when they did not get a response. When operator informed station that he had rolled the break, they informed us that they never got the tally to tell them they were on. Tally was on PCR3, not PCR2 where tease was coming from. News started late at 09:01:10
Resolution: 
Operator rolled term break manually and gave station new start time of 9am news.

Graphics channel got stuck as we began the newscast. More than half the screen was a blue slate. We went to break and cleared the graphics channel. I'm told it is a known problem that happens infrequently.

A11 THAO REACT   Reporter was in the wrong spot in the studio so we did not see him during his reporter toss.

Videos were not playing out in monitors before the show. Rich tried to reset the system but wasn't successful.

Anchors did not have air in IFB or anything in their monitors at any point during the show. Rich is investigating but thinks the system may be locked to PC2 (we were in PC3). We worked around it with cues out of SOTs and breaks.

C18  FINALS PROMO   Two promo cards were put in the rundown as fullscreens so they were miscoded and played out in black.

D block - System automatically wiped through to the end of the block. We saw only black and ABC swipes until the director was able to get a shot of the anchor on camera to air. Cause of problem unknown.

"RE: 4:30pm Discrepancy Report","After the show we tested different opens into the FS. It appears Opens into FS do not work. The FS worked, the open worked just not back to back. Sadly because this was a last minute change due to breaking news getting shuffled around there was no time to test the combination.

Cascade of issues at the top of the show. Our live cam of the GG Bridge accident moved two minutes before the top of the show and could not be moved back in time.

Scott Spitz's ultra-sleek dynamic 3M video for JR's toss didn't playout properly :( so we just saw it as a static graphic. We believe it's an issue with the encoder - investigating.

We had an Xpression error before the show that stopped chips and FS from working. Rich rebooted the system and it was good to go about 8 minutes to air.

½ maps ended up back to back on A41/42 so they didn't run correctly.

Labels for the frames in B9 were for equal boxes when they should've been offset. It's fixed for future shows.

E9 680 CLOSURE - the map here in Half frames advanced from the 680 closure to map of the Hwy 37 closure (back to back in rundown). Same issue appeared in earlier shows but was not seen at the time.

We got around it by bringing Dion on camera and then going to the NATSOT. In the F segment Dion's mic didn't open for several seconds even though the code was correct.

Please note for Anser's package the photos are safe to use the family did not want a courtesy for them.

Misspelling on A18 super - it's been fixed.




C18 49ers VO was too short for the script. We tried to get off of it and move onto the C19 FS. The graphic animated on, then went to black. It worked fine in the runthrough. We can't figure out why it will no longer playout. I recreated it and the new version does work.

There was a curse word on one of the clips for OAK GAZA PROTEST. The clip had been replaced before the show, but did not land on all of the brios (specifically, did not hit brio 8). So, the clip that was there prior was still cued up & aired (briefly). As soon as we saw it, Kurt advanced off the clip.




Slight miscommunication with Cornell had him tossing to soundbites out of order. But Kurt played them back-to-back & Cornell rolled with it on the fly.

Top of 5: mics were closed even though they were coded correctly. Director had to work around them. 
Top of 6: ABC live shot went down seconds before reporter's slot. Had to use backup pkg very last minute. 
      - Live shot returned mid-pkg, so we took the reporter for a live tag and Q&A. 

Middle of 6: story that was floated was still in prompter and threw everything off.

The graphic in the monitor behind Lyanne did not work on her intro for some reason. Very strange, because Jen says it did work when she ran through the show earlier. But Jen was able to remedy it while we were in Lyanne's pkg & the graphic worked for the tag.




Minor cg issue in Zach's pkg where a reporter name showed up over another person's name, instead of on top of the banner. Zach's writer is fixing it before this airs again.

No prompter operator at the top of the show so Kristen read the top off her iPad. She had scrolled a bit too far in the hello and started with the second story rather than the first, but got back on track.

With our C block locked in due to a pre-taped segment, we asked DC3 to kill a promo in break 3 to end on time.

The wrong videos aired in the preshow. Director determined he needed to double-click any/all clips in order for the right video to cue up. So that is what he had to do for the entire A block in order for the right video clips to air (the first click, the wrong video cued up. the second click, the correct video cued up everytime). Director switched to the backup server during break 1 and the issue was solved.  At this point, I am not sure why this occurred and engineering has been called to determine the root of the problem but I have not heard back.

"Re: 5P & 530P SHOW REPORT 3/26","The problem came up again prepping for the 11pm promo. It turns out, the Anch(_L) microphone was muted on the virtual audio console.  It wouldn't have mattered if Dan was on the 5p or the regular Anchor mic.  Most likely it was muted during an earlier show to avoid mic interference.

The 5pm show was the first time that microphone was used in PC2 on the afternoon shift. Not much time between the 4 and 5 to find and correct this. 

We will be better collectively to restore the room to its default settings upon leaving... and know what to look out for in the future.

Thanks all, Jen Brown

Top of show the doppler appeared instead of Mt. Tam cam. Coding appears correct & we stepped through that fine during preshow. 

Secondly, FREMONT RESTAURANT WEEK was a late feed. The Traffic monitor failed to take both the PKG and toss VO... and came up black. We took a 2shot to reset and roll PKG.

	A12 FATAL 580 TRANSITION: Map was in black. Director caught it before he took it on air. But map would not show up on air, in preview, nothing. Engineering is investigating.

	A15 WEST PORTAL AX: Anchor not in position - so we didn't see setup video. Director and producer were managing other problems (like the above map) and weren't able to remind Kristen to move.

	F7 EXPIRED MAKEUP: Denise Dador baseline cg was over another name cg. Fixed for later shows.

      Note about the lottery graphic: it auto-filled the numbers and date but this might be worth a discussion because it also filled in the jackpot. Since no           one won it defaulted to the next jackpot.

GREAT work by everyone involved in the 7 on your side tax chat! Well organized by Simone, Renee, and others, well shot by Bill Thompson, excellent communication all around, and kudos to Dan Ashley for hustling up and down the stairs over and over!

Good work by Engineers, Transmission, Chris & Zach to get Zach's live shot up and ready to lead the 6! Greatly appreciated!

A22 VOTER TURNOUT MOC-FS graphic was slow to load in 3M. We stayed on A21 (a fullscreen) until the 3M was ready, but then it jeopardized our ability to get to A23 (promo card) and keep pace with the rest of the show.


First show in PC3 in a while! Would it be possible to get a longer cord on the keyboard for the producer station? The current cord doesn't allow for much movement. Thank you!

"RE: 6am show report 3/6","C5- Went to FS instead of BTI FS (and FS couldn't load when we tried to go back)

 

The script for C5 called to advance to Fullscreen, which was next (C7) in the rundown.

 

   A suggestion in the future would be to refer to election graphics as a source other than 

“Fullscreen,” since a Fullscreen is something different entirely than the BTI election graphics.

 

 

 



 

 

 



 





 

 

E46- Mic clip

 

The line used for E46 was copied into the rundown from a live hit\Toolkit, and as described in the text that was copied, it kills all audio that isn’t the Nemo audio described within the line.

 

   Suggestion: Create new lines, and not copy & paste.. 

 

 



 

E49- Mic clip

 

Exact same scenario and solution as E46

A10 COLD OPEN SOTVO - no anchor mics. Delay in trying to get them open caused ripple effect of delays through A15.

A25 TEAM ANSER CORNELL BOXES - waiting for camera to get a 2shot caused delay in taking boxes

A45 HOW TO VOTE FS - ghost float in the graphic from the line before (THANKS JR BOXES) caused this fullscreen not to show up. Sat on the next element during the whole read.

B15 MAIN WEATHER - Phil walked in front of the chromakey while it was hot.

D12 MODERN VOTING - ghost float in the graphic from the line before (THANKS ZACH BOXES) caused us to jump over the oncam intro and go straight to VO. Went back on cam, then went back to Vo.

	A4 HELLO: Anchors out of position for the top of the newscast. They  were at anchor desk, should have been at 3M.  We then got behind on the next stories - so didn't see the Voting FS or the team coverage frames.

	D1 S: VOTE Stinger: Stinger didn't key - saw gray screen at end of stinger. Likely an Xpression issue - will reboot at 7pm. 

	Also - lots of issues with very slow Xpression today, include inability to see preview a couple of times and inability to drag graphics into rundown. Dalet was also extremely slow throughout the day.

Overnight, I was not able to save gfx on xpression. Director reset something, so it started working, but stopped working again. 

This happened 3 times. At one point, I was seeing the new/correct banner in preview, but it was not saving in the copy. I kept getting this message attached. 

Engineering did another reset later in the morning and it was fine.
