E13 PIG BUTCHERING SCAM PKG - the Xpression graphic was incompatible for the ADH. So the prior ADH graphic appeared instead. Jen had checked this pre-show and everything worked fine... but not here for some reason. Jen was able to punch up a generic slate until we rolled PKG.

Adding that the prompter at the Flash cam is not operable. This is part of an ongoing issue engineering is aware of and working on. Producers may want to avoid the Flash until the prompter is fixed.

The show open did not roll. Unclear why. We just came right up on Kristen &amp; then the music we usually use over the 3M came in a little bit late.


We also briefly lost Phil Matier's mic during the A block. Douglas took a FS &amp; said that wiped out Phil's mic.

Narrative


System was slow today - weird gremlins. CGs would take a long time to go in, SOTs were slow to roll, etc.


C4 OPEN AI IMPACT: About 15 seconds in, we dumped out of the package. No known reason why. Director rolled it again and we started from the beginning. Was fine the second time around.


D1 PRIME: We were heavy due to aforementioned package incident. The plan was to come back to Prime FS with music for about 5-seconds. Kristen didn't hear my directions nor the directors and tried to adlib over graphic.


E2 HOLIDAY TRAVEL: MNF was still in anchors IFB at the top of the 4:30. Dan tapped his mic ... a bit of awkwardness standing at TX CTR before starting to read.


E19 TEASE 5: Somehow two 3M graphics ended up in script. One was completely blank - the first one, of course. We had to stay on previous script VO until we could get an OC shot of Dan.

A few hiccups today. Off the top, there was a bit of a delay in the hello. Here's the note from Julian: Weird - I had no sound, not monitors - everything was in black at the start of the show


The open music also played again when we pulled up the Biden Xi Filoli fullscreen. Unclear why.


There was also a bug up for a bit that was not our current look, and said it was 100 degrees outside. Also unclear why.


There were some issues in the B block too. Douglas said G1 wasn't clearing. And we also went to black at one point.

In the middle of the 6, prompter went black while the Anchor was reading, so anchor read off of the ipad for a little less than a minute. 
At the end of the 6, the wrong SOT was played and ended up being played twice.

Narrative


A10/A11 HORIZON AIR INCIDENT: A few problems with script formatting and coding. The script had single parentheses instead of double parentheses, so copy showed up in prompter that wasn't supposed to be there. This left Dan struggling a bit until prompter could catch up.
In addition, some codes were deleted from lines A10 &amp; A11. The missing code caused the anchors mics to open up after they had already shut down. We briefly hear Kristen talking during Dan's hit.


Please be VERY careful when putting in cgs or adding copy to scripts that are already coded. This can cause major problems in a newscast.
For example, there should be a code after Dan's name here ... that code would have prevented some of the issues today.

-- Dalet froze about 6 different times for me throughout the morning for several minutes.

-- GMA called and said the IFB we used for the tease was buzzy or static. Our buttons weren’t pushed down so I wasn’t sure what the deal was. Let transmission/engineering know. They usually use the 0021 number. We gave them the 0022 number instead – and there were no issues. I think it was on their end --- transmission and I called the 0021 number and it sounded clear. Just a heads up – in case you use that number.

Narrative
 
A9 SF MIDDLE EAST: 


*   CG times incorrect/extra cgs. Needs to be fixed before next run. (Producers are aware)

*   Typo in cgs. Had San Raphael instead of San Rafael
A36 3M TEASE
*   graphic showed downtown Oakland. Should have been the Port of Oakland
B1 DEFACED MURAL
*   Package missed slot. Had to run at the end of the block instead of the top

C5 LATINO LEADERS
*   Might want to rewrite script. SOT had Tony Thurmond saying &quot;Si Se Puede&quot; twice, but never referenced what that means. While most of us know... our viewers may not.
A couple of housekeeping things:

*   Kristen was late to set. She didn't get into the studio until 1:30 before the newscast started. Way to close to the top of the show to show up.

*   Heard clicking from Lyanne's mic. Might have been the fan. This isn't the first time, need to figure out a way to fix this.

E6 WEATHER REM - the live bug didn't show up on the tease CG, even though it was filed. Chris went back and tried to manually bring up the CG and the live bug showed up. Then he ran through the block again in the break and the live bug didn't show up. Unknown cause.

C block guest joined the Zoom approximately one-minute before her segment. Transmission confirmed we had her. Then, just as Kristen tossed to her, the guest's signal dropped out. We continued with the B block guest in the C block. Kristen did a good job juggling on-air. I will follow up with transmission, but it appears to be a technical error that was out of our control.

-We learned at 6:54 that Phil had to leave by 715... He was stacked for 745 - so that scramble to take him off the top led to some camera issues. Also BAM wasn't switched over from LIVE DESK so Jobina re-routed so we could have control when we took video full. 


Other than that rough start - rest of the show came together -- good job everyone.

Narrative
 
The preshow got messed up because Kristen read the cold open by accident instead. Her iPad was in the wrong place. She did not read what was in the prompter.


The 3M at the top of the show didn't work correctly. The images on the 2nd &amp; 3rd panel didn't reveal. Unclear why.


Lena's pkg cgs had &quot;live&quot; on the banners. They got dragged over from another template/page by mistake.


C6 - Fall foliage pkg - there was a misspelling on the banner. &quot;Foliage&quot; was spelled wrong. We dropped the banner once we saw it.


F4 - the cg did not make it on the screen for the COVID vax story. Unclear why.

Thanks to everyone for the help&#8230; a few things happened juust before we went on air.
Game went long.. so atg/and 9p show accordian&#8217;d 
(what was unclear from the email was break structure for 30 minutes and off time of 9pm changed bc dc3 decided to use break 3 as the terminal break.. which was a diff length than the original terminal break)
The quake also happened at 9:14
And then the oak police commission voted
Sooo needless to say-thanks for everyone who helped rearrange/update things!
 
 
A2: Show open- the daytime open (at 930pm show)
A4: 9p hello- anchors had to start at int-d bc of atg (monitor behind them was atg sideways)
 
Show ended up being 9:30- 9:58:01
We had two internal 2:00 breaks

At 6:45a, the prompter was in the wrong place, throwing off the director and anchors. 
We were supposed to toss to the reporter, but the prompter was on the wrong stories. It seems like multiple stories were skipped.  
Prompter person says the reporter script was not showing up, which caused a domino effect of things being wrong. 
Reporter script looked fine on producer’s, director’s, and reporter’s ends.

5PM
A15     LEVIS CURFEW     Prompter was in the wrong place so the wrong video aired for a few seconds until the director caught up.
Unknown if this issue is connected to the prompter issue in the 6pm.


6PM
Prompter did not reflect any changes made to the rundown after approximately 5:50pm. Floated stories still showed up in prompter, resulting in the wrong video airing for one story. Edits made to scripts did not show up in prompter. 


In addition, Prompter A froze and we switched to the backup prompter, which then froze right before sports. After about a minute, Prompter B was functioning again. 


Engineering is investigating.

The Oak Airport camera was out of phase for one of our bump backs during the show. Otherwise, we had a good show.

Thank you to everyone who helped get the breaker on at the top of the show! 


It was a little clunkier than planned because our map did not make slot &amp; we accidentally went to vo before sky7 briefly, when it was supposed to be the other way around. But I appreciate everyone rolling with the punches.


We also had a few audio glitches with the A block guest - it cut out briefly twice. Kurt seems to think it's because the guest was soft-spoken &amp; that tends to mess with Zoom.

C5    AMY BERRY   Anchor lost her IFB. First, she could not hear the guest, then she could not hear anyone on the PL. Liz did a great job reading the guest's lips to determine when to ask the next question. Kurt tried to switch out her IFB, but none of the IFBs were working. Producer ran into the studio to give time cues. Worked out ok on air. Engineering is resetting the IFB system.

KABC WX signal dropped around the 6am B Block. Had to kill multiple WX hits and throw in random PKGS last minute to make up for the time. They say it was due to a network issue with TVU.
We then had Shayla phone in and voice over her WX graphics and live shots, but the audio ended up sounding terrible so we cut her off. 
Her IFB was also dropping in and out during the show (when she actually had signal), so she did not hear every time queue. 
 
No weather in cut-ins because of the technical issues.

KABC WX signal dropped around the 6am B Block. Had to kill multiple WX hits and throw in random PKGS last minute to make up for the time. They say it was due to a network issue with TVU.
We then had Shayla phone in and voice over her WX graphics and live shots, but the audio ended up sounding terrible so we cut her off. 
Her IFB was also dropping in and out during the show (when she actually had signal), so she did not hear every time queue. 
 
No weather in cut-ins because of the technical issues.

A25 CARJACK STABBING PKG - ghost float. We rolled the VO for the next story, which was related, so we thought it was a problem with the pkg. Came out to Zach who adlibbed live (thanks Zach!). In the break we realized what had happened and brought the pkg back in the next block. Thanks Dalet.


D5 TOSS FINNEY MOC-FS - graphic disappeared in the 3M as soon as we took it. Chris tracked down coding error and fixed it.


Anchors heard a weird high pitched buzzing noise on occasion in the final block of the show. Off and on, they say it sounded like a fax machine. Unknown cause.

Narrative


A7 APD SCANDAL: Missed slot causing a cascade of issues. Package missed slot because there were curse words on signs and shirts at the protest. Editors were trying to blur and cover - but didn't have enough time.


*A17 DUBOCE STABBING was the next package, but it wasn't in at the top of the show, so I had to run two VSV's.


*D2-D8 SCHOOL TRAFFIC I had moved up Stephanies package and corresponding scripts at the top of the show to replace both A-block packages, and even though the director and I could see the scripts in Dalet, they weren't in Overdrive or in the anchors Ipads, so the anchors couldn't adlib a toss to Stephanie nor could the system see any video to roll the package.


At this point Dion's package went in and we were able to get back on track.


B2 RENT VS OWNING: Director's code for the 3M in the intro disappeared - so it took a while to get to the graphic.




Big thanks to the anchors and Josh for rolling with the punches today. Thanks also to the media managers who were trying ... despite the odds.

Lost CGs in break 3. We could see anchor names at 630 (but without the abc7 logo in the middle) and nothing else. Per Rick Rubin -- CG1 locked up, studio software was not responding, killed and restarted app. Got CGs back at 632. Thanks for the quick action Rick!


Great work by Casey, Larry, and the whole sports department on a busy day!

Narrative


We were in tape mode at the top of the show, so Kristen couldn't see herself, which is why there was a delay in her saying hello. Douglas said he needed to run the salvos.


Also in the A block, the video didn't play when we cut to frames. This also bit us in the C block. This was the same issue we had on Thursday when we launched Caprica. I thought this was fixed?

All completely unknown issues - perhaps due to new Caprica software system? it seems like Caprica is slow in responding to our graphics system. Kurt &amp; those in the know are aware. 
*   Top of show we only saw the bug... graphics were stuck... but then the 2shot anchor names appeared over the cold open CG

*   Delayed I-wipe to A14 oncam

*   B25 showed ATG promo Warriors but then immediately cut to a previous 'Advancer' FS (this was coded in the other graphics Viz channel entirely)

Overdrive had some serious problems in the final segment of the newscast. The director couldn't get it to do any of his commands - so we saw the Prime FS for the first half of the toss to package.

Started late due to the special report on the indictment of former President Trump. We got Rory Little at the very last moment for the top of the show, literally right as ABC wrapped up. Thank you to everyone for rolling with the last second changes. Took us a little time to get CGs and video for the Rory segment but it was a fantastic Q&amp;A with Julian. Only aired 2 segments and killed breaks to stay on time.

The lines got dragged out of order for the preshow, so they did not match what was in the script. Not sure how that happened, but the producer did not notice. Sorry!


We went to black at the top of the F block tease. That's because it was missing a cg and that triggered bad things. Producer had changed it to a top vo tease, instead of oncam to start - so the cg was deleted. 🙁

DC3 ran the wrong promo. It was Friday's instead of tonight's. Media Managers looked into it and was told DC3 made a mistake.


In the F-block during some how the show control switched from PC3 to PC2. We got through the block and made it to break but the director was unable to get control back in PC3. During communication with DC3 we asked if we could get control back and at least signoff but we were told there would not be enough time. Director and engineering investigating.

Show started fine, but within minutes our signal was not going out on air. Viewers were seeing World News Tonight and Localish. Issue was resolved at 60320 as we started Stephanie's story. Anchors addressed the issue on air at 607, immediately after Stephanie's story.


B2 TOSS LYANNE INT - monitor graphic showed I-Team before it switched over to BABBA.


D14 DR PATEL FS - skipped over FS and went to the tease


Went to black a little early at the end of the show.

Narrative
 
IMPORTANT​​: There is an error in the LIST OF PREVIOUS OPD CHIEFS!!!!


This ran in at least 2 other shows today, but Scott Spitz just caught an error. On FS #5, it says Sabrina Landreth served for 3 years, 1 month &amp; 1 day. But, our script says the following: Sabrina Landreth took over for just over six months.



I'm not sure whether the graphic is correct or the script is, but either way, they don't match -- so PLEASE DO NOT RE-RUN THIS until it can be clarified.


Also, Dave Russo shared this note regarding the same story, after it aired just now:
CORRECTION REQUEST FROM FORMER OAKLAND INTERIM CHIEF Susan Manheimer- SHE CALLED AND WOULD LIKE IT TO NOT SAY SHE TOOK AN EARLY RETIREMENT- THAT WAS NOT TRUE- SHE SIMPLY SERVED AS INTERIM CHIEF FOR 10 MONTHS BETWEEN KIRKPATRICK AND ARMSTRONG.

Narrative


Both reporter PKGs missed slot


Lena/M6 had issued with their editing system
This was the note Stifter sent me about the situation: We cannot edit in Guerneville because we don’t have enough Internet reception to download files. So we have to drive half an hour to put it together. It’s a time crunch to get a package on if everything goes well - today we ended up with some issues with my editor - and 10 minutes trying to fix it - results in being late despite getting my script early and hustling.


Gloria/M19 kept having their signal take a hit when they tried to feed
When Gloria's PKG aired, there were cg issues. Incorrect grammar on the fact banner, plus a bottom line on the banner that said &quot;Pacifica resident.&quot; Errors have been corrected, so this is good for future use.


SF VS NWS - it appears there was a change made to this script without the @@@@ symbols. The CG was removed for VO2. This threw off the director and caused him to roll the SOT early, while the anchor was still reading.


IMPORTANT: OLD VIDEO aired in the preshow tease and the lead-in to Lena's PKG. To be fair, the video was not clearly labeled, but it shows flooding from 4 years ago. DO NOT REUSE THESE CLIPS!!! (producer will take the fall for this one!)




ABC network special report started at 11:35AM
Breaks 5, 6 and 7 in the second half hour did not air because of the special report. I confirmed with DC3 to kill these 3 breaks.

Major audio issues in PC2. We did have Kumasi &amp; Spencer's mics to start the show, but we didn't have any sound on clips. So, the show open was silent. 


Then between the B &amp; C blocks, we lost Kumasi's mic as well.


We had to have DC3 roll break 3 right after break 2. Then Jen coordinated with Douglas to take over from PC3. We had to finish the show out of PC3, going seamless from the C block straight into the goodbye.


Unclear of the cause. Engineers are investigating.
